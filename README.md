# Assignment-Road-Accidents-
In this assignment we have to find out if males are worst drivers or is it females.

Dataset Source
The "RTA_Dataset.csv" is a comprehensive dataset containing information about various road traffic accidents, including details about the drivers, vehicles involved, road conditions, and other relevant factors. The dataset was obtained from a reliable source and serves as the foundation for conducting the analysis.

Jupyter Notebook Analysis
In the "notebooks" directory of this repository, you will find the Jupyter Notebook named "accidents.ipynb." This notebook showcases the entire data analysis process step by step.
Data Loading: The notebook begins by loading the "RTA_Dataset.csv" into a pandas DataFrame to facilitate further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook delves into EDA, where I explore the dataset's structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the various attributes present.
Identifying High Accident Contributors: One of the primary focuses of the analysis is to determine which group of drivers is responsible for the majority of accidents. By analyzing the data, I discovered whether male or female drivers had more accidents and presented the findings with supporting visualizations.
Factors of Male Driver Accidents: The analysis goes deeper into male driver accidents, exploring different factors that contribute to these accidents. The notebook investigates factors like road conditions, vehicle types, time of day, and any other relevant variables associated with accidents involving male drivers.
Debunking Misconceptions: Lastly, I present evidence that challenges the misconception that females are worse drivers. The analysis examines relevant data to demonstrate that females are, in fact, not significantly worse drivers than males, debunking the stereotype.

Conclusion
As per the analysis we found out that females are actually good drivers than males, it is just a misconception that males are great drivers.
